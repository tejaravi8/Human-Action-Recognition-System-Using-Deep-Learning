# Human-Action-Recognition-System-Using-Deep-Learning
 This project focuses on Human Action Recognition (HAR) using deep learning techniques  to detect and classify actions in both videos and live streams. A hybrid CNN-LSTM model  is used, where CNN extracts spatial features and LSTM captures temporal motion across  frames.
